# onlyDraw
A browser extension that allows user to doodle over the active web page.

## Inspiration
While studying one might want to draw on the same page in order to make others or self understand the concept in a deeper manner. For example: while studying recursion one might have to draw a recursive tree in order to understand the concept fully.

## What it does
The extension allows user to draw with different colour and different stroke weight to choose from.

## How we built it
**Frontend**- HTML5,CSS3,Semantic UI
**Backend**- Javascript,P5.js

## Challenges we ran into
- Have to learn about the extension from scratch as we didn't have any idea on how extensions work.

## What we learned
Learnt a lot about how extensions work and how the code flows on a browser.
## What's next for OnlyDraw
- Adding snipping feature.
- Adding more colour variants.

## Resources
